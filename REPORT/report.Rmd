## **INTRODUCTION**
`r text_spec("**1. Background**", background = "#D05A6E", color = "white", bold = T)`<br> 

**In the entertainment industry, there is an increase demand for variety of forms and expressions in entertainment to be represented in the community. Music is one form of entertainment highly demanded by all-ages within the market. As the society advances in along with the changes in social science and politics, this leads to a change in the form of music represented or expresses the condition of the community at the point of time. For instance, Rhythm and Blues (R&B) is popular in the 80's while Rap and Reggae is popular in the 90's and Electronic Dance Music (EDM) is formed in early 21st century. Songs classification is a topic which seeks to understand the user's interest to a specific genre based on their previous historical selection of songs. This research seeks to understand what are the variables that would be contribute as an insight and utilise machine learning such as XGBoost to classify the appropriate song genre as a recommendation.**

<br>`r text_spec("**2. Problem Statement**", background = "#D05A6E", color = "white", bold = T)`<br>

**How can we select the best recommended song based on users' historical song selection?**

<br>`r text_spec("**3. Objectives**", background = "#D05A6E", color = "white", bold = T)`<br> 

**We would be performing the procedures as below:**<br>
  1) Performing Data Cleaning and extract datasets for Year 2020.<br>
  2) Performing Data Analysis and identifying relationship between variables.<br>
  3) Implementing Machine Learning models such as classification and regression.<br>

<br>`r text_spec("**4. Details' Dataset**", background = "#D05A6E", color = "white", bold = T)`<br> 

**The dataset is collected from Spotify and stored in Kaggle with the topic "Spotify Top Tracks Popularity Analysis". For this research, we have chosen to only look at dataset from Year 2020 which has 11607 and variables is as follows:**<br>

                "Name of the songs' artist",
                "Whether the song was published as a single or as part of an album or compilation",

                "It is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy",
                "The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1",
                "The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks. Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical strength (amplitude). Values typical range between -60 and 0 db",
                "indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0",
                "Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track. The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry), the closer to 1.0 the attribute value. Values above 0.66 describe tracks that are probably made entirely of spoken words. Values between 0.33 and 0.66 describe tracks that may contain both music and speech, either in sections or layered, including such cases as rap music. Values below 0.33 most likely represent music and other non-speech-like tracks",
                "A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic. 1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic",
                "Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”. The closer the instrumentalness: value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track contains no vocal content. Values above 0.5 are intended to represent instrumental tracks, but confidence is higher as the value approaches 1.0",
                "Detects the presence of an audience in the recording. Higher liveness values represent an increased probability that the track was performed live. A value above 0.8 provides strong likelihood that the track is live",
                "A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry)",
                "The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration",
                "The duration of the track in milliseconds",
                "An estimated overall time signature of a track. The time signature (meter) is a notational convention to specify how many beats are in each bar (or measure)",
                "The predominant genre of an artist according to our reclassification of Spotify’s 1200 genres",

<h4><center>**Explanation**</center></h4><br>

<p>**Based on the distribution seen above, there are some notable highlights:**
<ul><li>Most of the variables are showing continuous distribution except for **Key** variable as it is a discrete variable.</li>
<li>For **Intrumentalness** and **Popularity** variable is right-skewed(positive) where mode is on the lower end </li></ul><br>

<h4><center>**Explanation**</center></h4><br>
<br><p>**Based on the correlation heatmap seen above, *GREEN* indicates highest/positive correlation *RED* indicates the lowest/negative relations.**

<li>The second highest *positive correlation* is 35% or 0.35 shown between **valence(song mood)** and **danceability** *indicates* </li>
<li>Another strong relationship can be seen between **acoustics** and **energy** which is 60% or 0.60, though it is **negatively correlated** *indicates* with more acoustics the less energising the music becomes.</li>
<li>Another strong relationship can be seen between **acoustics** and **loudness** which is 56% or 0.56, though it is **negatively correlated** *indicates* higher loudness when there are less acoustics.</li></ul><br>
